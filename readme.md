## Review: Git and Github

Remember, *git* and *github* are two different things! Git is a version control system for managing your source code. Github is a platform to host your code online so others can access it and collaborate with you on it. You can think of Github as social media for Git! For a more detailed explanation, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUuTYDg9XoI)!

### Commit Messages: Best Practices

You can find a [complete list of best practices here](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53), but in general, your commit message should clearly state what content/features/changes are being added to the code base and be in a complete sentence. Another best practice is to make many commits! Everytime you add something meaningful, even something really small, is a good time for a commit! This way if your code gets all messed up, you can pinpoint the exact change that caused the issue, and you won't lose much working code. Otherwise, if your commits are few and far between and you have to go back to an earlier version, you might end up losing more than you need to!
